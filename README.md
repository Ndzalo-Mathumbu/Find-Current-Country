# 🌍 Find-Current-Country

> A JavaScript project built to deeply understand asynchronous programming — from old-school XMLHttpRequest to modern Promises, async/await, and Promise combinators. It fetches country data, pinpoints user location, and dynamically updates the UI using real APIs.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates different ways to handle asynchronous JavaScript operations to fetch and display real-world data:
- Shows detailed country information using the Restcountries API.
- Pinpoints the user’s current country via the browser’s Geolocation API combined with reverse geocoding (BigDataCloud).
- Implements various async patterns, from `.then()` chains to `async/await` for clearer code.

I built and structured this to understand not only the APIs, but also how to manage multiple async tasks and handle errors gracefully.
